"Select an era, choose your faction, and lead it to victory against random "
"factions over a series of random maps. For the standard experience, choose "
"the Random Campaign Default era.\n"
"(Intermediate level, 7 scenarios.)\n"
"\n"
"Important Note: Due to a bug, 'Scenario Start' saves for this campaign are "
"broken. It is recommend to make a manual saves on each map, or set 'maximum "
"auto-saves' high enough with 'delete auto-saves at the end of scenarios' "
"turned off.\n"
"\n"
"The campaign is balanced for being played with 'use map settings', though "
"any setting on the Configure Game screen can be changed, and will take "
"effect throughout the campaign.\n"
"\n"
"The following unit advancement defines are enabled in this campaign: Ancient "
"Lich, Armageddon Drake, Dwarvish Arcanister, & Orcish High Warlord.\n"
"\n"
"Any Default or Age of Heroes style era can be selected. If an Age of Heroes "
"style era is selected, the campaign will start at scenario 4. It's "
"recommended to use normal eras (i.e. eras that are just collections of "
"factions). If the era contains events or other game play mechanics, "
"unexpected results or incompatibilities may occur.\n"
"\n"
"Modifications may or may not work with this add-on, use at own risk. "
"However, there is special cross-functionality with Custom Campaign. Upon "
"finishing Random Campaign, your army will be saved for use in Custom "
"Campaign, even if you don't have it. If the Custom Campaign modification is "
"used when starting Random Campaign, it will allow you to select one of your "
"armies for the campaign.\n"
"\n"
"Requires BfW 1.11.10 or greater. Requires the latest versions of 'Era of "
"Legends' & 'Ultimate Random Maps' to be installed.\n"
